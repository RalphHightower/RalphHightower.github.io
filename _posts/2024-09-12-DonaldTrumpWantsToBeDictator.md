## [Why Trump’s comments about ABC’s broadcast license matter](https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-comments-abcs-broadcast-license-matter-rcna170786)
*The problem isn’t just that Donald Trump threatened a network’s broadcast license. The problem is that he keeps threatening networks’ broadcast licenses.*<br />Sept. 12, 2024, 9:28 AM EDT<br />By Steve Benen

It is no surprise that Trump holds admires strong-arm dictators, President Vladimir Putin of Russia, Supreme Leader of North Korea Kim Jong Un[^11], and Minister Victor Orbán of Hungary. Putin is former KGB; he knows how to control people. Flattering Trump will get you anything you want.

One of the principles of America is freedom of speech and a free press. Trump wants to control what the media says about him.

America has no need for state-run media.
