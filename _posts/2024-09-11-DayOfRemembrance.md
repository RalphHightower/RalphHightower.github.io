I remember the day well. I was listening to the radio when I heard the DJ announce that a plane had crashed into one of the World Trade Centers; initially, they thought that it was a small airplane. I turned on the TV to watch the second passenger jet purposefully fly into the second World Trade Center. I said to myself,  "al-Qaeda." This wasn’t the first time that they attacked America. 

The news media websites were straining from the requests. They had to ditch the graphics and display updates simply as text. I got more information from [Slashdot: News for nerds, stuff that matters](https://slashdot.org/).

That night, I was moved by the unity of US Representatives and Senators united on the Capitol steps. It has been and long time since Democrats and Republicans were united. 
 
- February 26, 1993. Van bomb in World Trade Center parking garage, North Tower. Six people killed.
- August 7, 1998. Twin US Embassy bombings in East Africa. 224 killed.
- October 12, 2000. USS Cole attacked. 17 sailors killed[^11]:. 37 injured. 
- September 11, 2001. 2,977 deaths[^11]. Suicide bombers ijacked passenger jets; flew into the World Trade Centers and destroyed. Pentagon attacked. Passengers overcame the hijackers and prevented another major destruction. 

[^11]: I ain’t counting the deaths of the al-Qaeda terrorists.
