#excerpt: “The Apprentice: White House” ended a tumultuous four year season ingloriously on January 6, 2021, at an extraordinary low point in American history when thousands of far-right undesirables, Pride Boys, Zero Percenters, Oath Losers, and Booger Loogies, lay siege on the US Capitol in a vain attempt of insurrection to overthrow a fair election. Cancel the rerun of “The Apprentice: White House – Wrecking Ball 2025”."
