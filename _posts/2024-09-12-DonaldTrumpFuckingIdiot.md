title: 'Donald Trump is a Fucking Idiot'
---
I initially started out putting my opinions of Trump on this page, [Opinions/Donald Trump Is a Fucking Idiot / Ralph Hightower](https://ralphhightower.github.io/RalphHightower/Opinions/DonaldTrumpIsAFuckingIdiot.html).

But it has become too unwieldy to keep it updated, so I switched to the blogging format. 

I was an independent voter, but watching **The Apprentice: White House** unfold in what was then known as the Republican Primary. 

Both political parties fucked up in 2016.

- The Democrats chose Hillary because it was *"her turn"*.
- Whereas the Republicans chose the worst of the worst. The Republican Party died in 2016. It is now the Trump Party, and also his legal defense fund for business, personal, and also government legal problems.

The Republican Party died in July 2024, when the convention chose the most temperamental, volatile, unfit, and unqualified candidate among the *"Dirty Two Dozen"*. It is now known as the Trump Party. 

Characteristics of Trump:

1. Boastful

28. Sore Loser
29. Spoiled Brat
30. Sore Winner[^113]

[^111]: **The Victim Card.** Trump plays the victim card when things don't go his way, or fail. *"It's not my fault. It's the Democrats fault."* Or someone else's fault.
[^112]: Trump whining ***"It’s not fair!"***
[^113]: The *"I got bigger crowds!"* falsehood comparing his inaugural crowd to Obama's.
[^114]: Bill Clinton has the same problem. He can't keep his pants fly closed around women.

### The Only Person That Can Change My Assessment of Trump

**The only person that can convince me that Donald Trump is not a fucking idiot is Donald Trump himself.**

*How?*

- Tame your temper! Quit throwing **Trumper Tantrums!**
- Quit your pathological lying and tell the God-damned truth!
- Grow up and start treating people with respect. I.e., quit that childish behavior of calling people names.
- Be a true leader! A true leader recognizes team members, and subordinates for their accomplishment, and accepts the blame when things fail. A true leader does not use intimidation and fear.
- Accept the fact that the president lives under a microscope. You will be praised by some and condemned others.

Trump may act *"presidential"* for five minutes, but it is impossible for him to be an adult.

### Government Ain't Business

Government is not a business and should not be run as a business. Government provides services and has laws to manage the smooth functioning of society. Trump has no business experience running a large corporation having executive officers with a board of directors as independent advisors. The Trump Organization is *simply* a large family-run business, which he runs like a dictatorship.

### Leadership

Leadership is not intimidation and fear. Trump has absolutely, no fucking clue as to how government works. He thinks that he can run government like his family owned business. Trump thinks that he can just bark orders and people will jump through hoops like a circus poodle and that he can fire and hire federal employees at will.

A true leader recognizes and praises their team for their successes and accepts blame and responsibility when things fail. Trump claims credit for others' accomplishment, the *"I did that all by myself!"*, and blames others for his failures, the *"It's not my fault."*[^111]

### The Apprentice: White House

As can be seen in the [Presidential Rankings Survey - Historians Rank the Top 10 Presidents / C-SPAN Survey on Presidents 2021](https://www.c-span.org/presidentsurvey2021/?page=overall), section 17 of this page, Trump places dead last among modern day president's.

Trump may have been a breath of fresh air, but nothing has changed about Trump. He's still a *bull in a china shop.* After four years, Trump still thinks that he can run America like a dictatorship.

### Nepotism and Cronyism

Trump's executive office and cabinet was rife with [nepotism](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nepotism) and [cronyism](http://www.merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day/2024/09/03/).

Trump's daughter, Ivanka Kushner and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, were unqualified to be part of his executive office.

### Cult Worship and Idolatry

#### Acolytes and Sycophants

Senator Lindsey Graham (T-SC) has the attention span of a squirrel. After the attempted insurrection on January 6, 2021, Graham said *"That's it! I'm done with Trump."* He was on NBC's Meet The Press after the failed assassination of Trump in 2024. He said that he was supposed to play golf with Trump that weekend. Graham is one of Trump's [sycophants](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sycophant). He has he head so far up  Trump's ass that he doesn't know if it's night or day.

[Senator Tim Scott (T-SC) – Meet the Press. May 5, 2024](https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/federal-funding-is-a-privilege-not-a-right-tim-scott-tells-college-presidents-full-interview-210290757680) refused to answer a simple 'yes/no' answer to the question "Will you accept the election results if Trump loses?". As one of Trump's [acolytes](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/acolyte), Scott is Trump's "lawn jockey". He does not have the courage to stand for what's right.
