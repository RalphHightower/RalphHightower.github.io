# Watching the Debate â€” Differences in Facial Expressions

The 'Don'[^11] is displaying the same facial expression that he displayed in his booking photo in New York City, and Atlanta. It was also that scowl sitting at the defense table during his New York false business records that were really bribery payments to porn star, Stormy Daniels. 

Kamala is using facial expressions that displays astonishment, disapproval of Trump's lies and *"facts"*.

On the question directed to Trump about his 2020 election loss, if I were Kamala, I would have looked directly at the camera and ask, "I want to ask America a question. Do you really think that seven million citizens would have conspired to commit voter fraud and risk a felony conviction and a jail sentence? Personally, I don't know seven million people."

Typical Trump. More lies. Moderators keep bringing up actual truth and Trump denies that it ever happened. 

January 6, 2021, is a **block mark** in American history. Trump glorifies violence. 

1. September 11, 2001.
2. Bombing of FBI building in Oklahoma City. April 19, 1995.
3. January 6, 2021 insurrection. Storming and vandalizing the U.S. Capitol, assaulting law enforcement officers.
