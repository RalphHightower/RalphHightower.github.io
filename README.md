# Ralph Hightower @ github.io 

I freeze time; I photograph. I have 50++ years of computer programming and
software development; most recently using C# and .Net. Athough I am retired 
from software development as a vocation, I am still active for personal projects.
I have witnessed two final space flights: the US half of the Apollo/Soyuz Test 
Project, and Space Shuttle STS-135 Atlantis with the Final Four \[CDR Chris 
Ferguson, PLT Doug Hurley, MS1 Sandra Magnus, MS2 Rex Walheim\], as well as 
the final landing next to the control tower of the Shuttle Landing Facility 
(200 yards from the runway).
