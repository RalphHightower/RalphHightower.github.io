I freeze time; I photograph. I have 50++ years of computer programming and
software development; most recently using C# and .Net. Athough I am retired 
from software development as a vocation, I am still active for personal projects.
I have witnessed two final space flights: the US half of the Apollo/Soyuz Test 
Project, and Space Shuttle STS-135 Atlantis with the Final Four \[CDR Chris 
Ferguson, PLT Doug Hurley, MS1 Sandra Magnus, MS2 Rex Walheim\], as well as 
the final landing next to the control tower of the Shuttle Landing Facility 
(200 yards from the runway).

Photography is another creative endeavor that I have enjoyed since 1980. My
first camera was the Canon A-1 which was an innovative camera for the 80's,
which I still use. I added one of my bucket list cameras in July 2013, a 
Canon F-1N with the AE Finder FN and the AE Motor Drive FN. December 2013,
I added a DSLR, the Canon 5D Mark III with the EF 24-105mm f4L. I enjoy 
photography period. It doesn't matter if I am shooting film or digital.
