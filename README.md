### Personality Tests

[^11]: I'm a [Chevy](https://www.chevrolet.com/) guy and Tahoe is a model name. I love it!
[^12]: People with INTP preferences are quiet, thoughtful, and analytical. They tend to put a great deal of consideration into everything they do. INTPs are generally easygoing and genuine. They might seem to “zone out” from time to time while they consider new concepts or explore how something works. They are often happiest laying low and working hard behind the scenes. While they may seem impersonal with people they don’t know well, they like to have a close group of people they open up to. They are naturally adept at building structural models or coming up with new concepts for solving problems. They tend to see the world as a system that can be analyzed, and this is how they approach just about everything in life.<br />• 4.8% of the population • 5.8% of men • 4.0% of women •<br />× analytical × conceptual × logical ×<br />× quiet × independent × easygoing ×<br />× complex × driven × curious ×<br />× questioning × methodical × values competence ×<br />× self-critical × thoughtful × innovative ×<br />× problem solver × reflective × autonomous ×
[^13]: I had to Google the GOT Personality Test. Oh, I don't subscribe to HBO, so all I know of Game of Thrones is that's it's sorta like King Arthur set in medieval times.<br />I took the GOT Personality Test. I saw that reference in a LinkedIn news article about using personality tests to get the right balance of different personalities. I think using a personality test to determine employment is a form of discrimination and I use that rather strictly because there's race discrimination and gender discrimination.
[^14]: Primary Character: Mance Rayder <br />Nickname: King Beyond the Wall<br />Traits: Inspiring, Formidable, Pioneer<br />Your primary character is Mance Rayder. You are a charismatic, calm, and determined man with strong leadership qualities. You tend to rise quickly through the ranks of any organization you enter. You have good social and diplomatic skills, allowing you to collaborate with many different types of people. You have an honest yet stern persona which earns you respect and admiration of those around you. You are very trusting which can be your greatest weakness. You value freedom above all else.
[^15]: Secondary Character: Ser Jaime Lannister<br />Nickname: The Kingslayer<br />Traits: Arrogant, Sarcastic, Apathetic<br />Your secondary character is Ser Jaime Lannister. You are charming and capable of impeccable politeness in the right circumstances. In the wrong circumstances, others perceive you to be disdainful, sarcastic and arrogant. However your arrogance may just be confidence, as you excel in a number of areas, including intelligence. You don't mock others over minor failings but you are usually very blunt. You typically just say what you are thinking without regard to the feelings of those that you perceive as incompetent. You regard ruthlessness as a virtue and behave in an unapologetically amoral way. You're not politically ambitious and sly maneuvering is not your way.
[^16]: Tertiary Character: Ygritte<br />Nickname: Ygritte<br />Traits: Wild, Uncoventional, Determined<br />Your tertiary character is Ygritte. You are brave and unconventional. You have a mind of your own and prefer not to conform with the demands of societu're cunning and value freedom above all else. You're loyal, but also very passionate and you follow to your heart much more than your head. You live a very fulfilled life, chasing your dreams but this sometimes causes others to mistrust you although you have little enmity in your heart.

I freeze time; I photograph. I have 50++ years of computer programming and software development; most recently using C# and .Net. Athough I am retired from software development as a vocation, I am still active for personal projects. I have witnessed two final space flights: the US half of the Apollo/Soyuz Test Project, and Space Shuttle STS-135 Atlantis with the Final Four \[CDR Chris Ferguson, PLT Doug Hurley, MS1 Sandra Magnus, MS2 Rex Walheim\], as well as the final landing next to the control tower of the Shuttle Landing Facility (200 yards from the runway).

Photography is another creative endeavor that I have enjoyed since 1980. My first camera was the Canon A-1 which was an innovative camera for the 80's, which I still use. I added one of my bucket list cameras in July 2013, a Canon New F-1 with the AE Finder FN and the AE Motor Drive FN. December 2013, I added a DSLR, the Canon 5D Mark III with the EF 24-105mm f4L. I enjoy photography period. It doesn't matter if I am shooting film or digital.
